### Project Initialization and Planning (Sprint Zero) ###

1. Define the Project Vision and Goals
    - Project Vision: To build a microservices-based blogging platform that allows users to register, create, edit, and manage blog posts, leave comments, and receive notifications.
    - Project Goals:
        * Implement a modular architecture using microservices.
        * Ensure high-quality code with automated testing.
        * Deploy the application to the cloud for real-world use.
        * Document the project thoroughly to demonstrate your skills.

2. Set Up the Scrum Framework
    - Scrum Team Roles:
        * Product Owner: Define and prioritize features (I will take on this role).
        * Scrum Master: Ensure the Scrum process is followed (I will also take on this role).
        * Development Team: Implement the features (I will take on this role).
    - Scrum Artifacts:
        * Product Backlog:
        * Sprint Backlog:
        * Increment:

3. Set Up Project Management Tools
    3.1 Project Board:
        - Tool used is Azure DevOps: It creates a pipeline so that commits to the GitHub repo invoke a continuous integration build in Azure DevOps. Once that build is complete, it will invoke a continuous delivery deployment to push the bits out to Azure, creating the required resources, if necessary.
