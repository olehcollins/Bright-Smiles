3. Project Management Tools for Agile Development
    3.1 Project Board:
        - Tool used is Azure DevOps: It creates a pipeline so that commits to the GitHub repo invoke a continuous integration build in Azure DevOps. Once that build is complete, it will invoke a continuous delivery deployment to push the bits out to Azure, creating the required resources, if necessary. Setup documentation (https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/github-azurepipelines/)
