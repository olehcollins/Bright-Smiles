postgresql@16
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@16
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-initdb.html

postgresql@16 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have postgresql@16 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find postgresql@16 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/lib"
